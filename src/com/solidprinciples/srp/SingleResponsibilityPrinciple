EmployeeStore class is responsible for storing employees and sending an email

EmployeeStore's method is  sendEmail(Employee employee, String content);
If you want want to send html content we need to add one more method sendHtml content. 
but what happens when we are asked to support different protocols for sending emails for both content types. 
Overall class will look very ugly and difficult to read and maintain.

Solution
1. IEmailSender
2. IEmailContent

Advantages:
1. Easy to understand and maintain 2. Improved usability 3. Easy to test
