Liskov Substitution Principle

If class A is a subtype of class B, then we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program.

Here for Electric car we don't have the engine
By throwing a car without an engine into the mix, we are inherently changing the behavior of our program. 
This is a blatant violation of Liskov substitution and is a bit harder to fix than our previous 2 principles.

One possible solution would be to rework our model into interfaces that take into account the engine-less state of our Car.
